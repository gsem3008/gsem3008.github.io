                <p class="w3-large">Girl Scouting is a program established by the Girl Scouts of the United States of
                    America (GSUSA) for girls who are grades K-12. GSUSA has been in continuous operation since 1912
                    when it was founded in Savannah, Georgia, by Juliette Gordon Low. The National headquarters of the
                    GSUSA are now located in New York City. Girl Scouting is nonprofit—adult, unpaid volunteer leaders
                    work with the girls in the program, and are supported by paid staff and professionals in local area
                    councils.</p>
                <h5 class="w3-center">How Is Girl Scouting Organized?</h5>
                <p class="w3-large">Girls in the GSUSA are organized into grade-appropriate levels:</p>

                        <p class="w3-large">Girl Scout Troop 3008 organized during the fall of 2018. At the
                            moment is is a single-level group, growing with the girls as they progress through
                            the grade levels. The troop program focuses on the many different badges and patches
                            girls have available to them through Girl Scouting at their current program level,
                            as well as allowing the girls to participate in outings, field trips, and other fun
                            stuff.</p>
                        <p class="w3-large">Troop 3008 meets twice a month, once as a troop meeting for
                            badge/petal work and once as an outing/activity to further educate the current
                            badge.</p>
                        <h5 class="w3-center">Adult Leadership</h5>
                        <p class="w3-large">Many willing girls each year are unable to join Girl Scouting
                            because not enough adults volunteer to be leaders. Having leaders for the various
                            activities of Troop 3008 is very important, as well as non-leader parent support.
                            Girl Scouting is a volunteer-driven organization. Everyone, including parents, is
                            expected to pitch in for the girls. In this way, Girl Scouting is different than
                            many other after-school activities.</p>

                                    Leadership</span> GSUSA requires Troop
                                3008 to have a minimum leadership team of at least a primary leader and a
                                co-leader, one of whom must be an adult female. In addition to these two
                                mandatory positions, we also have two adult leaders to help with onsite
                                activities.</li>

                                Parents will need to step forward for campouts, driving, field trips, and cookie
                                sales. Except for troop meetings and overnighters, parent helper/volunteers are
                                not required to become registered members of Girl Scouts, and do not need to be
                                background checked. However, our Council does encourage parent helper/volunteers
                                to be registered to support the council and GSUSA membership.</li>

                                3008 has "offsite" fieldtrips and activities once a month. These outdoor
                                activities are usually done on a “pay-as-you-go” system, instead of being done
                                through troop dues. Outdoor activity fees could include things like a program
                                fee (for set activities at Girl Scout camping facilities, or fees for using a
                                state park), plus food costs and infrastructure costs. Sometimes the troop is
                                able to cover a portion or all of the costs, however this is not the
                                default.</li>

                                has available for girls individually in their levels, as well as for troops.
                                These activities usually have a cost, although some are free. Depending on
                                whether the girl goes by herself, or with her level, or as a troop, will depend

                        <p class="w3-large">The money to cover the expenses of Girl Scouting will come from the
                            following sources:</p>
                        <ul class="w3-large">

                                allow

                                3008 to solicit donations, but it does not prohibit the troop from accepting
                                them. Donations in excess of $250 must be given as an earmark to the Girl Scouts
                                of Eastern Missouri Council, which in turn will send the earmarked funds back to
                                Troop 3008.</li>

                                    Raisers</span>Girl Scouts strongly
                                encourage the girls themselves to start early, and learn how to earn and pay for
                                their
                                activities in Girl Scouting. This can be done through family allowances with set
                                jobs, and paying dues as part of allowance. The Troop can also put together
                                fundraisers in which the girls can participate - things like yard sales, for
                                example. Fundraisers other than product sales must be approved by the Troop 3008
                                leaders committee and by the Council.</li>

                                    Product Sales</span>Another way
                                to raise funds is through the officially sanctioned product sales. There are two
                                of these per year - the famous cookie sales in the January-February time frame
                                and the fall product sales. Troop 3008 encourages, but does not require, each
                                girl to participate in one or more of the product sales. From all funds earned
                                from product sales, Troop 3008 will retain 100% and allows the girls to decide
                                what to do with the money they have earned as a troop. Cookie money, for
                                example, could be used to pay any of the expenses listed above, for a service
                                project, a charitable donation, or for a special outing or trip.</li>

                            we do need to ask for dues to cover the expenses of snacks, room fees, badges, and
                            materials for activities. We are asking for $60/girl. If this fee would stop your

                        <p class="w3-large">Girl Scouting has always prescribed a set of national safety rules
                            for girls and leaders to follow in the Girl Scout experience. These are set out in
                            the Volunteer Essentials, the Volunteer Policies, and the Safety Activity
                            Checkpoints. These resources should be used to determine GS policies and procedures
                            for any particular situation. When in
                            doubt, leaders contact the Council for a ruling on matters which may not be covered
                            in these resources</p>

                        <h5 class="w3-center">Diversity and Inclusivity</h5>
                        <p class="w3-large">You may have heard about controversies within Scouting over religion
                            and sexual orientation. These controversies only affect the Scouting program for
                            boys, known as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). In years past, the BSA took several policy
                            stands regarding exclusionary membership rules for its youth and adult membership, such as a
                            required belief in God or a supreme being, and
                            denial of youth or adult membership based on sexual orientation. Within the past few
                            years, BSA has amended its policies to allow youth and adult membership in BSA
                            regardless of sexual orientation, but has retained the requirement for a belief in God or a
                            supreme being. BSA has also
                            retained the option of its chartering partner organizations to exclude youth and adult
                            members on sexual orientation basis, if the chartering organization has a religious
                            objection.</p>
                        <p class="w3-large" style="font-style: italic">The Girl Scouts of the USA, of which Troop 3008
                            is a part, is expressly diverse and inclusive, and does not subscribe to any
                            discriminatory or exclusionary membership
                            policies. Girl Scouting is open to all - well, except for youth males.</p>
                        <p class="w3-large">On youth membership, BSA made the controversial decision to allow
                            girls to join its
                            Cub Scouting programs (grades 1-5), starting the fall of 2018, and officially
                            changed
                            their name to Scouts BSA. Troop 3008 will remain strictly within Girl
                            Scouting/GSUSA. Girl
                            Scouting itself remains just for girls, no youth male members. Girl Scouting does
                            allow transgender girls to join Girl Scouting, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
